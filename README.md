# miniYoutube
A website where you input a channel url or name and it displays the most recent videos in a simple and clean design. 
This is a way for me to get more used to using Flask so I'll be adding more features as time goes by.

#Installation
All you have to do is download the code and run it on localhost or some server of yours. I'll put this on Heroku soon.

#What it does
Right now all it does it prompt you for a channel name or url. It then embeds the latest 20 videos of that channel.

#Future
I'll be making the UI look better, I'll add accounts, and I'll add more features that make this a simple and clean alternative to going to youtube and seeing the latest videos through the channel. If you have any suggestions just email me.
