#Update
I have pushed the application to [Heroku](https://quiet-cove-22921.herokuapp.com/)

#What it is
A website where you input a channel url or name, or a tag like "pokemon" and it displays videos accoring to what order you selected in a simple and clean design. This is a way for me to get more used to using Flask so I'll be adding more features as time goes by.

#Installation
All you have to do is download the code and run it on localhost or some server of yours. Then in settings.yml fill in the API key you get for it. You can get the key and enable the Youtube Data API [here](https://console.developers.google.com/)

#What it does
Right now all it does it prompt you for a channel name or url, or tag. It then embeds the vidoes of that channel or tag according to what order you selected.

#Future
 - I'll be making the UI look better.
 - I'll add accounts
 - I'll add more features that make this a simple and clean alternative to going to youtube and seeing the latest videos through the channel or tag. 
If you have any suggestions just email me.
