A website where you input a channel url or name, or a tag like "pokemon" and it displays the most recent videos in a simple and clean design. This is a way for me to get more used to using Flask so I'll be adding more features as time goes by.

#Installation
All you have to do is download the code and run it on localhost or some server of yours. I'll put this on Heroku soon.

#What it does
Right now all it does it prompt you for a channel name or url, or tag. It then embeds the latest 20 videos of that channel or tag.

#Future
 - I'll be making the UI look better.
 - I'll add accounts
 - I'll add more features that make this a simple and clean alternative to going to youtube and seeing the latest videos through the channel or tag. 
 - I will also add ordering methods such as by views, time, or popularity. 
If you have any suggestions just email me.
